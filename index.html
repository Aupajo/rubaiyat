    <h1>The Rubaiyat</h1>

<p>Omar Khayyam</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Wake! For the Sun, who scatter&rsquo;d into flight <br>
The Stars before him from the Field of Night, <br>
Drives Night along with them from Heav&#39;n, and strikes <br>
The Sultan&rsquo;s Turret with a Shaft of Light. </p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Before the phantom of False morning died, <br>
Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried, <br>
&ldquo;When all the Temple is prepared within, <br>
Why nods the drowsy Worshipper outside?&rdquo; </p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before <br>
The Tavern shouted&ndash;&ldquo;Open then the Door! <br>
You know how little while we have to stay, <br>
And, once departed, may return no more.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Now the New Year reviving old Desires, <br>
The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires, <br>
Where the White Hand Of Moses on the Bough <br>
Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. </p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose, <br>
And Jamshyd&rsquo;s Sev&#39;n-ring&rsquo;d Cup where no one knows; <br>
But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine, <br>
And many a Garden by the Water blows, </p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>And David&rsquo;s lips are lockt; but in divine <br>
High-piping Pehlevi, with &ldquo;Wine! Wine! Wine! <br>
Red Wine!&rdquo;&ndash;the Nightingale cries to the Rose <br>
That sallow cheek of hers t&#39; incarnadine. </p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring <br>
Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling: <br>
The Bird of Time has but a little way <br>
To flutter&ndash;and the Bird is on the Wing. </p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Whether at Naishapur or Babylon, <br>
Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run, <br>
The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop, <br>
The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one. </p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say; <br>
Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday? <br>
And this first Summer month that brings the Rose <br>
Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away. </p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Well, let it take them! What have we to do <br>
With Kaikobad the Great, or Kaikhosru? <br>
Let Zal and Rustum bluster as they will, <br>
Or Hatim call to Supper&ndash;heed not you </p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>With me along the strip of Herbage strown <br>
That just divides the desert from the sown, <br>
Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot&ndash; <br>
And Peace to Mahmud on his golden Throne! </p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, <br>
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread&ndash;and Thou <br>
Beside me singing in the Wilderness&ndash; <br>
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! </p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Some for the Glories of This World; and some <br>
Sigh for the Prophet&rsquo;s Paradise to come; <br>
Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go, <br>
Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! </p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Look to the blowing Rose about us&ndash;&ldquo;Lo, <br>
Laughing,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;into the world I blow, <br>
At once the silken tassel of my Purse <br>
Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>And those who husbanded the Golden grain, <br>
And those who flung it to the winds like Rain, <br>
Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn&rsquo;d <br>
As, buried once, Men want dug up again. </p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon <br>
Turns Ashes&ndash;or it prospers; and anon, <br>
Like Snow upon the Desert&rsquo;s dusty Face, <br>
Lighting a little hour or two&ndash;is gone. </p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Think, in this batter&rsquo;d Caravanserai <br>
Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day, <br>
How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp <br>
Abode his destined Hour, and went his way. </p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>They say the Lion and the Lizard keep <br>
The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep: <br>
And Bahram, that great Hunter&ndash;the Wild Ass <br>
Stamps o&#39;er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep. </p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>I sometimes think that never blows so red <br>
The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; <br>
That every Hyacinth the Garden wears <br>
Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head. </p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>And this reviving Herb whose tender Green <br>
Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean&ndash; <br>
Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows <br>
From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen! </p>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Ah, my Belov&#39;ed fill the Cup that clears <br>
To-day Past Regrets and Future Fears: <br>
To-morrow!&ndash;Why, To-morrow I may be <br>
Myself with Yesterday&rsquo;s Sev&#39;n Thousand Years. </p>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>For some we loved, the loveliest and the best <br>
That from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest, <br>
Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before, <br>
And one by one crept silently to rest. </p>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>And we, that now make merry in the Room <br>
They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom <br>
Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth <br>
Descend&ndash;ourselves to make a Couch&ndash;for whom? </p>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, <br>
Before we too into the Dust descend; <br>
Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie <br>
Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and&ndash;sans End! </p>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>Alike for those who for To-day prepare, <br>
And those that after some To-morrow stare, <br>
A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries <br>
&ldquo;Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<p>Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss&rsquo;d <br>
Of the Two Worlds so wisely&ndash;they are thrust <br>
Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn <br>
Are scatter&rsquo;d, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust. </p>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<p>Myself when young did eagerly frequent <br>
Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument <br>
About it and about: but evermore <br>
Came out by the same door where in I went. </p>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<p>With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow, <br>
And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow; <br>
And this was all the Harvest that I reap&rsquo;d&ndash; <br>
&ldquo;I came like Water, and like Wind I go.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<p>Into this Universe, and Why not knowing <br>
Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing; <br>
And out of it, as Wind along the Waste, <br>
I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. </p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>What, without asking, hither hurried Whence? <br>
And, without asking, Whither hurried hence! <br>
Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine <br>
Must drown the memory of that insolence! </p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<p>Up from Earth&rsquo;s Centre through the Seventh Gate <br>
rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate; <br>
And many a Knot unravel&rsquo;d by the Road; <br>
But not the Master-knot of Human Fate. </p>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<p>There was the Door to which I found no Key; <br>
There was the Veil through which I might not see: <br>
Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee <br>
There was&ndash;and then no more of Thee and Me. </p>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<p>Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mourn <br>
In flowing Purple, of their Lord forlorn; <br>
Nor rolling Heaven, with all his Signs reveal&rsquo;d <br>
And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn. </p>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<p>Then of the Thee in Me works behind <br>
The Veil, I lifted up my hands to find <br>
A Lamp amid the Darkness; and I heard, <br>
As from Without&ndash;&ldquo;The Me Within Thee Blind!&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XXXV</h3>

<p>Then to the lip of this poor earthen Urn <br>
I lean&rsquo;d, the Secret of my Life to learn: <br>
And Lip to Lip it murmur&rsquo;d&ndash;&ldquo;While you live <br>
Drink!&ndash;for, once dead, you never shall return.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<p>I think the Vessel, that with fugitive <br>
Articulation answer&rsquo;d, once did live, <br>
And drink; and Ah! the passive Lip I kiss&rsquo;d, <br>
How many Kisses might it take&ndash;and give! </p>

<h3>XXXVII</h3>

<p>For I remember stopping by the way <br>
To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay: <br>
And with its all-obliterated Tongue <br>
It murmur&rsquo;d&ndash;&ldquo;Gently, Brother, gently, pray!&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XXXVIII</h3>

<p>And has not such a Story from of Old <br>
Down Man&rsquo;s successive generations roll&rsquo;d <br>
Of such a clod of saturated Earth <br>
Cast by the Maker into Human mould? </p>

<h3>XXXIX</h3>

<p>And not a drop that from our Cups we throw <br>
For Earth to drink of, but may steal below <br>
To quench the fire of Anguish in some Eye <br>
There hidden&ndash;far beneath, and long ago. </p>

<h3>XL</h3>

<p>As then the Tulip for her morning sup <br>
Of Heav&#39;nly Vintage from the soil looks up, <br>
Do you devoutly do the like, till Heav&#39;n <br>
To Earth invert you&ndash;like an empty Cup. </p>

<h3>XLI</h3>

<p>Perplext no more with Human or Divine, <br>
To-morrow&rsquo;s tangle to the winds resign, <br>
And lose your fingers in the tresses of <br>
The Cypress&ndash;slender Minister of Wine. </p>

<h3>XLII</h3>

<p>And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press <br>
End in what All begins and ends in&ndash;Yes; <br>
Think then you are To-day what Yesterday <br>
You were&ndash;To-morrow You shall not be less. </p>

<h3>XLIII</h3>

<p>So when that Angel of the darker Drink <br>
At last shall find you by the river-brink, <br>
And, offering his Cup, invite your Soul <br>
Forth to your Lips to quaff&ndash;you shall not shrink. </p>

<h3>XLIV</h3>

<p>Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside, <br>
And naked on the Air of Heaven ride, <br>
Were&rsquo;t not a Shame&ndash;were&rsquo;t not a Shame for him <br>
In this clay carcase crippled to abide? </p>

<h3>XLV</h3>

<p>&lsquo;Tis but a Tent where takes his one day&rsquo;s rest <br>
A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest; <br>
The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash <br>
Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest. </p>

<h3>XLVI</h3>

<p>And fear not lest Existence closing your <br>
Account, and mine, should know the like no more; <br>
The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pour&rsquo;d <br>
Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour. </p>

<h3>XLVII</h3>

<p>When You and I behind the Veil are past, <br>
Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last, <br>
Which of our Coming and Departure heeds <br>
As the Sea&rsquo;s self should heed a pebble-cast. </p>

<h3>XLVIII</h3>

<p>A Moment&rsquo;s Halt&ndash;a momentary taste <br>
Of Being from the Well amid the Waste&ndash; <br>
And Lo!&ndash;the phantom Caravan has reach&rsquo;d <br>
The Nothing it set out from&ndash;Oh, make haste! </p>

<h3>XLIX</h3>

<p>Would you that spangle of Existence spend <br>
About the Secret&ndash;Quick about it, Friend! <br>
A Hair perhaps divides the False and True&ndash; <br>
And upon what, prithee, may life depend? </p>

<h3>L</h3>

<p>A Hair perhaps divides the False and True; <br>
Yes; and a single Alif were the clue&ndash; <br>
Could you but find it&ndash;to the Treasure-house, <br>
And peradventure to The Master too; </p>

<h3>LI</h3>

<p>Whose secret Presence, through Creation&rsquo;s veins <br>
Running Quicksilver-like eludes your pains; <br>
Taking all shapes from Mah to Mahi; and <br>
They change and perish all&ndash;but He remains; </p>

<h3>LII</h3>

<p>A moment guess&rsquo;d&ndash;then back behind the Fold <br>
Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll&rsquo;d <br>
Which, for the Pastime of Eternity, <br>
He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold. </p>

<h3>LIII</h3>

<p>But if in vain, down on the stubborn floor <br>
Of Earth, and up to Heav&#39;n&rsquo;s unopening Door <br>
You gaze To-day, while You are You&ndash;how then <br>
To-morrow, You when shall be You no more? </p>

<h3>LIV</h3>

<p>Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit <br>
Of This and That endeavour and dispute; <br>
Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape <br>
Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit. </p>

<h3>LV</h3>

<p>You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse <br>
I made a Second Marriage in my house; <br>
Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed <br>
And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. </p>

<h3>LVI</h3>

<p>For &ldquo;Is&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is-not&rdquo; though with Rule and Line <br>
And &ldquo;Up&rdquo; and &ldquo;Down&rdquo; by Logic I define, <br>
Of all that one should care to fathom, <br>
Was never deep in anything but&ndash;Wine. </p>

<h3>LVII</h3>

<p>Ah, but my Computations, People say, <br>
Reduced the Year to better reckoning?&ndash;Nay <br>
&#39;Twas only striking from the Calendar <br>
Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday. </p>

<h3>LVIII</h3>

<p>And lately, by the Tavern Door agape, <br>
Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape <br>
Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and <br>
He bid me taste of it; and &#39;twas&ndash;the Grape! </p>

<h3>LIX</h3>

<p>The Grape that can with Logic absolute <br>
The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute: <br>
The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice <br>
Life&rsquo;s leaden metal into Gold transmute: </p>

<h3>LX</h3>

<p>The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord <br>
That all the misbelieving and black Horde <br>
Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul <br>
Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword. </p>

<h3>LXI</h3>

<p>Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare <br>
Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare? <br>
A Blessing, we should use it, should we not? <br>
And if a Curse&ndash;why, then, Who set it there? </p>

<h3>LXII</h3>

<p>I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must, <br>
Scared by some After-reckoning ta&#39;en on trust, <br>
Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink, <br>
To fill the Cup&ndash;when crumbled into Dust! </p>

<h3>LXIII</h3>

<p>Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise! <br>
One thing at least is certain&ndash;This Life flies; <br>
One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; <br>
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies. </p>

<h3>LXIV</h3>

<p>Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who <br>
Before us pass&rsquo;d the door of Darkness through, <br>
Not one returns to tell us of the Road, <br>
Which to discover we must travel too. </p>

<h3>LXV</h3>

<p>The Revelations of Devout and Learn&rsquo;d <br>
Who rose before us, and as Prophets burn&rsquo;d, <br>
Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep, <br>
They told their comrades, and to Sleep return&rsquo;d. </p>

<h3>LXVI</h3>

<p>I sent my Soul through the Invisible, <br>
Some letter of that After-life to spell: <br>
And by and by my Soul return&rsquo;d to me, <br>
And answer&rsquo;d &ldquo;I Myself am Heav&#39;n and Hell:&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXVII</h3>

<p>Heav&#39;n but the Vision of fulfill&rsquo;d Desire, <br>
And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire, <br>
Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves, <br>
So late emerged from, shall so soon expire. </p>

<h3>LXVIII</h3>

<p>We are no other than a moving row <br>
Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go <br>
Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held <br>
In Midnight by the Master of the Show; </p>

<h3>LXIX</h3>

<p>But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays <br>
Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days; <br>
Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays, <br>
And one by one back in the Closet lays. </p>

<h3>LXX</h3>

<p>The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes, <br>
But Here or There as strikes the Player goes; <br>
And He that toss&rsquo;d you down into the Field, <br>
He knows about it all&ndash;He knows&ndash;HE knows! </p>

<h3>LXXI</h3>

<p>The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, <br>
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit <br>
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, <br>
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it. </p>

<h3>LXXII</h3>

<p>And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky, <br>
Whereunder crawling coop&rsquo;d we live and die, <br>
Lift not your hands to It for help&ndash;for It <br>
As impotently moves as you or I. </p>

<h3>LXXIII</h3>

<p>With Earth&rsquo;s first Clay They did the Last Man knead, <br>
And there of the Last Harvest sow&rsquo;d the Seed: <br>
And the first Morning of Creation wrote <br>
What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. </p>

<h3>LXXIV</h3>

<p>Yesterday This Day&rsquo;s Madness did prepare; <br>
To-morrow&rsquo;s Silence, Triumph, or Despair: <br>
Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: <br>
Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. </p>

<h3>LXXV</h3>

<p>I tell you this&ndash;When, started from the Goal, <br>
Over the flaming shoulders of the Foal <br>
Of Heav&#39;n Parwin and Mushtari they flung <br>
In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul. </p>

<h3>LXXVI</h3>

<p>The Vine had struck a fibre: which about <br>
If clings my being&ndash;let the Dervish flout; <br>
Of my Base metal may be filed a Key, <br>
That shall unlock the Door he howls without. </p>

<h3>LXXVII</h3>

<p>And this I know: whether the one True Light <br>
Kindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me quite, <br>
One Flash of It within the Tavern caught <br>
Better than in the Temple lost outright. </p>

<h3>LXXVIII</h3>

<p>What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke <br>
A conscious Something to resent the yoke <br>
Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain <br>
Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke! </p>

<h3>LXXIX</h3>

<p>What! from his helpless Creature be repaid <br>
Pure Gold for what he lent him dross-allay&rsquo;d&ndash; <br>
Sue for a Debt he never did contract, <br>
And cannot answer&ndash;Oh, the sorry trade! </p>

<h3>LXXX</h3>

<p>Oh, Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin <br>
Beset the Road I was to wander in, <br>
Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round <br>
Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin! </p>

<h3>LXXXI</h3>

<p>Oh, Thou who Man of baser Earth didst make, <br>
And ev&#39;n with Paradise devise the Snake: <br>
For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man <br>
Is blacken&rsquo;d&ndash;Man&rsquo;s forgiveness give&ndash;and take! </p>

<h3>LXXXII</h3>

<p>As under cover of departing Day <br>
Slunk hunger-stricken Ramazan away, <br>
Once more within the Potter&rsquo;s house alone <br>
I stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay. </p>

<h3>LXXXIII</h3>

<p>Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small, <br>
That stood along the floor and by the wall; <br>
And some loquacious Vessels were; and some <br>
Listen&rsquo;d perhaps, but never talk&rsquo;d at all. </p>

<h3>LXXXIV</h3>

<p>Said one among them&ndash;&ldquo;Surely not in vain <br>
My substance of the common Earth was ta&#39;en <br>
And to this Figure moulded, to be broke, <br>
Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXXXV</h3>

<p>Then said a Second&ndash;&ldquo;Ne&#39;er a peevish Boy <br>
Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy, <br>
And He that with his hand the Vessel made <br>
Will surely not in after Wrath destroy.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXXXVI</h3>

<p>After a momentary silence spake <br>
Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make; <br>
&ldquo;They sneer at me for leaning all awry: <br>
What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXXXVII</h3>

<p>Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot&ndash; <br>
I think a Sufi pipkin-waxing hot&ndash; <br>
&ldquo;All this of Pot and Potter&ndash;Tell me then, <br>
Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXXXVIII</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;Some there are who tell <br>
Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell <br>
The luckless Pots he marr&rsquo;d in making&ndash;Pish! <br>
He&rsquo;s a Good Fellow, and &#39;twill all be well.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>LXXXIX</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Murmur&rsquo;d one, &ldquo;Let whoso make or buy, <br>
My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry: <br>
But fill me with the old familiar juice, <br>
Methinks I might recover by and by.&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XC</h3>

<p>So while the Vessels one by one were speaking, <br>
The little Moon look&rsquo;d in that all were seeking: <br>
And then they jogg&rsquo;d each other, &ldquo;Brother! Brother! <br>
Now for the Porter&rsquo;s shoulder-knot a-creaking!&rdquo; </p>

<h3>XCI</h3>

<p>Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide, <br>
And wash the Body whence the Life has died, <br>
And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf, <br>
By some not unfrequented Garden-side. </p>

<h3>XCII</h3>

<p>That ev&#39;n my buried Ashes such a snare <br>
Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air <br>
As not a True-believer passing by <br>
But shall be overtaken unaware. </p>

<h3>XCIII</h3>

<p>Indeed the Idols I have loved so long <br>
Have done my credit in this World much wrong: <br>
Have drown&rsquo;d my Glory in a shallow Cup <br>
And sold my Reputation for a Song. </p>

<h3>XCIV</h3>

<p>Indeed, indeed, Repentance of before <br>
I swore&ndash;but was I sober when I swore? <br>
And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand <br>
My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. </p>

<h3>XCV</h3>

<p>And much as Wine has play&rsquo;d the Infidel, <br>
And robb&rsquo;d me of my Robe of Honour&ndash;Well, <br>
I wonder often what the Vintners buy <br>
One half so precious as the stuff they sell. </p>

<h3>XCVI</h3>

<p>Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! <br>
That Youth&rsquo;s sweet-scented manuscript should close! <br>
The Nightingale that in the branches sang, <br>
Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! </p>

<h3>XCVII</h3>

<p>Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield <br>
One glimpse&ndash;if dimly, yet indeed, reveal&rsquo;d, <br>
To which the fainting Traveller might spring, <br>
As springs the trampled herbage of the field! </p>

<h3>XCVIII</h3>

<p>Would but some wing&#39;ed Angel ere too late <br>
Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate, <br>
And make the stern Recorder otherwise <br>
Enregister, or quite obliterate! </p>

<h3>XCIX</h3>

<p>Ah, Love! could you and I with Him conspire <br>
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire, <br>
Would not we shatter it to bits&ndash;and then <br>
Re-mould it nearer to the Heart&rsquo;s Desire! </p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p>Yon rising Moon that looks for us again&ndash; <br>
How oft hereafter will she wax and wane; <br>
How oft hereafter rising look for us <br>
Through this same Garden&ndash;and for one in vain! </p>

<h3>CI</h3>

<p>And when like her, oh, Saki, you shall pass <br>
Among the Guests Star-scatter&rsquo;d on the Grass, <br>
And in your joyous errand reach the spot <br>
Where I made One&ndash;turn down an empty Glass! </p>
